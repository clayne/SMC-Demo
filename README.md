# SMC Demo

Simple C++ and assembly demo for Windows showing and testing SMC functionality and timing it.

SMC is still around and can still be very useful. It burns a few thousand cycles to get started (and up), but after that the ability to immediately execute code you are dynamically generating is extremely useful and versatile, and should not be the lost art that it is.
